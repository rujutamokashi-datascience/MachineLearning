As part of Supply Chain Analytics, the goal is to analyze the current product data and  model various algorithms that would help to predict if the products reach on time using various predictors from the E-Commerce dataset.

In this report I have used an E-Commerece Shipping data of an International company, that sells electronic products and is interested in the key insights from their customer database(Kaggle,2021). 
The dataset can be accessed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/prachi13/customer-analytics) which contains 12 feaures and 11000 observations.<br>
